# Variant Experiment Server SPI Standard Library
### Release 1.4.0
Contains pre-built lifecycle hooks and trace event flushers that can be used as is.
There's no need to compile and deploy this library because it comes with your Variant
server. But we hope this repository can help you kick-start your own development of custom
hooks and flushers. For more information on Variant SPI development refer to
[Variant Experiment Server Extension SPI User Guide](https://getvariant.com/documentation/server/variant-experiment-server-extension-spi-user-guide/).
