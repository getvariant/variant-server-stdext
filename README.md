# Variant CVM Server SPI Standard Library
### Release 1.3.1
Contains popular lifecycle hooks and trace event flushers that can be used as is.
There's no need to compile and deploy this library because it comes with your Variant
server. But we hope this repository can help you kick-start your own development of custom
hooks and flushers.
